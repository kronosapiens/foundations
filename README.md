# Data Structures
- linked list
- hash table (linkedlist- & array-backed)
- undirected graph (as adjacency list)
- binary min/max heap (array-backed)
- graph (directed/undirected)
- queue (array-backed)

# Algorithms
- mergesort
- depth-first search
- breadth-first search
- is_bipartite (via two-coloring)
- dijkstra's algorithm (with minheap)

# To run doctests (from project root):
`$ python -m <dir>.<module>`
